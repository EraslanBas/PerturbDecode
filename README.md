# PerturbDecode
## "An end-to-end computational pipeline for large Perturb-seq screens"

data QC and preprocessing; (2) identification of the effects of perturbations on genes; (3) learning the regulatory topology of perturbed and impacted genes for single and/or combinatorial perturbations; and (4) relating the regulatory (genetic) topology to physical interactions
