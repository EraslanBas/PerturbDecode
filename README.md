# PerturbDecode
## An end-to-end computational pipeline for large Perturb-seq screens


PerturbDecode is a framework developed for the automated analysis of large Perturb-seq screens. The workflow in PerturbDecode consists of: 


  * Data QC and preprocessing; 
  * Identification of the effects of perturbations on genes
  * Learning the regulatory topology of perturbed and impacted genes for single and/or combinatorial perturbations
  * Relating the regulatory (genetic) topology to physical interactions
